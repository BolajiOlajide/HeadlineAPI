### Development with Docker

Development with docker has been made simple. To get started make sure you have [docker](https://www.docker.com/) on your PC. You can download it [here](https://www.docker.com/).
Follow the following steps carefully to set the project up:
- Create a `.env` using the `.env.sample` file.
- Run the command `docker-compose up` to let the docker daemon start building the image and create the container.
- When you're done, use the command `docker-compose down` or `Ctrl + C` to stop the container.
